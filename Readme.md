# MLOps Template (PyTorch + DVC + MLflow + CI/CD)

A robust, production-ready MLOps pipeline designed for scalable image classification tasks using PyTorch. This project demonstrates the application of modern MLOps practices—like reproducibility, automation, monitoring, and containerization—to streamline the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

---

# Purpose & Motivation

This project was built to showcase my expertise in implementing MLOps workflows that bridge the gap between model development and production. It solves common challenges like:

-  Reproducibility – ensuring every step of the pipeline can be reliably reproduced using DVC
-  Experiment Tracking – comparing model runs and tuning performance with MLflow
-  Automation – integrating CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for seamless development and deployment
-  Scalability & Portability – using Docker to containerize and deploy ML models anywhere
-  Modular Design – following a clean architecture to maintain and extend the pipeline

This template is ideal for image classification problems, but it's modular enough to be extended to other supervised learning tasks.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pandu-12345/mlops-template.git
cd mlops-template
```

2. Setup Environment
```bash
conda create -n mlops_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate mlops_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 3. Reproduce Pipeline

# CI/CD Pipeline 

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Reproduces the full DVC pipeline
- Installs dependencies & runs tests
- Builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub

# Setup Secrets
